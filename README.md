# MMM-MyTemps

This is not going to be a useful Mod for anyone other than the guy i wrote it for [Richard238](https://forum.magicmirror.builders/user/richard238).

The php script runs on an Rpi with some temprature sensors on it.

The MM Module interrogates the php script and displays the result.

**DO NOT USE THIS MOD AS IS**
